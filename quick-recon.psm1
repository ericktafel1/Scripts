import-module ActiveDirectory

<# 
.Description  
This function performs some simple recon tasks for the user. We import the module and then issue the 'Get-Recon' command to retrieve our output. Each variable and line within the function and script are commented for your understanding. Right now, this only works on the local host from which you run it, and the output will be sent to a file named 'recon.txt' on the Desktop of the user who opened the shell. Remote Recon functions coming soon!  

.Example  
After importing the module run "Get-Recon"
'Get-Recon
